# Big KG-OLAP Appendix

This online appendix is part of the supplemental material for Big KG-OLAP implementation. Please refer to the [Appendix](./appendix.pdf)

## Dataset

In our experiments we used generated datasets based on AIXM data model[^1]. We developed an AIXM data generator tool[^2] to allow us to generate a realistic dataset. The tool is based on the donlon[^3]. The provided link explains how to build and use the tool to generate the desired dataset. In our case, we used the configuration file provided[^4], we specify the start and end time stamp, storage location, and storage type.
